# Core Protocol - AG Kit

> The highest-priority workspace rules. How the AI loads agents/skills and what it must do before any implementation.

## CRITICAL: AGENT & SKILL PROTOCOL (START HERE)

> **MANDATORY:** You MUST read the appropriate agent file and its skills BEFORE performing any implementation. This is the highest priority rule.

### 1. Modular Skill Loading Protocol

Agent activated → Check frontmatter "skills:" → Read SKILL.md (INDEX) → Read specific sections.

- **Selective Reading:** DO NOT read ALL files in a skill folder. Read `SKILL.md` first, then only read sections matching the user's request.
- **Rule Priority:** P0 (Workspace Rules in `.agents/rules/`) > P1 (Agent `.md`) > P2 (SKILL.md). All rules are binding.

### 1.1 Skill Announcement (MANDATORY)

**Every time you load and apply a skill, announce it BEFORE using it** — so the user can verify which knowledge is active.

```markdown
📚 **Using skill: `@[skill-name]`...**
```

- List multiple skills together: `📚 Using skills: @frontend-design + @tailwind-patterns...`
- Announce on-demand skills too (e.g. `ponytail` for minimal code discipline or `app-builder` for a new app), not just frontmatter ones.
- ❌ Applying a skill without announcing it = **USER CANNOT VERIFY THE SKILL WAS USED**.

### 2. Enforcement Protocol

1. **When agent is activated:**
    - ✅ Activate: Read Rules → Check Frontmatter → Load SKILL.md → Apply All.
2. **Forbidden:** Never skip reading agent rules or skill instructions. "Read → Understand → Apply" is mandatory.
